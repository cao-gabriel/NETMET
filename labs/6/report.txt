Multipath detection

Analysis

=> In a network perspective, what could be the issue of using Per-packet load-balancing ?
Packets can use two paths, but by doing this, when we traceroute, we can think that a router of the first path is connected to a router of the other path.

=> Can you formulate precisely the problem of false links with Per-flow load-balancing that lead to errors in the classic Traceroute output ?
The classic traceroute change the destination port of each probes so that it can link the probe with the response, the per-flow load balancing doesn't work and there are still false links issues.

Formulate a fix

=> What modification can we make to the algorithm of the classic Traceroute in order to avoid the false link issue ?
We can avoid changing fields in the packet

=> What other problem occurs if we implement that solution ? How can we overcome this issue ?
Issue : No matching probe/response

=> Traceroute is sending multiple probes per TTL. How can we know which request is matching the responses between these 3 probes with the same (flow,ttl) in our case ?
Find a field that we can change but not in header fields used by flow identification : checksum
