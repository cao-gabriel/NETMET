Traceroute:
	- The TTL field is the key of traceroute function
	- The UDP layer is used in probe packets by default
	- The router send back ICMP message in return
	- Traceroute has limits : it can returns star and it reply from non-ingress interface so it can have missing information and misleading information
	-per flow load balancing and traceroute changes the flow identifier with each probe, it can be resolved with paris traceroute. Per packet load balancing, no solution but no freuqent

BGP

- 70K ASes announcing 850k IPv4 prefixes
- 21k ASes announcing 98k IPv6 prefixes
- Intradomain routing protocol OSPF IS-IS
- Inter domain protocols BGP
- BGP updates data is in Oregon Route View, RIPE routing information servie. Peering with BGP routers worldwide, 500 sessions for route views, 30-40 sessions for RIPE RIS
- To communicate between border routers of differents ASes, we use external BGP
- To convey announcements inside an AS from one border to another, we use internal BGP
- BGP update limits : router representativeness, internal changes, changes not visible unless they affect inter domain routing, agregation changes to small prefixes get filtered

metrology introduction

- network monitoring for network operators : monitor service level agreements, fault diagnosis, security
- network monitoring for users: verify network performance, slect service provider, applications  manage network services
- network monitoring for application/service developers : verify application performance, tuning applicationsw to network conditions, server or path selection
- network monitoring for regulators, policy makers : comparison among ISPs, verification of compliance to regulatory laws, decisions about investments
- network monitoring is essential for sicentis : evaluate and design new systems, internet touches social/political aspects, structure and dynamics of the internet structure
- AS : distinct regions of administrative control , a set of routers and links managed by a single institution

-Measure internet infrastructure : find properties (delay, kitter, capacity, loss, topology) of partrs of the network (end to end path, as, link, router)
- Measure internet traffic : infer usage (link apps, patters, pirates) from network traffic (IP, tcp, udp packets, per flow stats, per interface counters)
-measure internet applications :infer application performance and usage (web page load time, video buffering rates, popularity of social network members) from entwork traffic or application (payload, intrument the app, crawl the app)

- Active measurement techniques : issue probes and analyse response (ping), measure traffci even whe, traffic is not possible measure network app performance, probing extra load
- Passive measurement : observe existing traffic tcp trace only wai to measure traffic, measure user experience, bheaviour, protocol exchanges, raise privacy concerns

- Vanatege point : end host connected to the internet active meashrement of end to end path, passivemetn measurement of host traffic. routers hosts in network path active measurement of network path passive measurement of traffic protocol exchanges configuration

-what to expect : identify properties that must hold : rtt less than delay of speed of light, number of bytes in a tcp connection < duration * max capacity, when properties fail to hold incorrect assumption, measurement error

-know the measuremdent tool : study precision and accuracy, examine outliers and spikes, monitor cofounding factors, evaluate synthetic data, compare multiple methods
- know where data comes from : log meta data with traces (any info required to understand measurement, remember data often used for unexpected purposes), version of measurement tool and paprameters, when where trace was recorded, clock preicion, drops missing data

- avoid disruption : active probing can overload networks, we should put contact info in probes, throttle probing, spread load
- respect privavy : get user informed consent, comply with local data protection laws, anonymize data when possible
-do no harm : identify potential harm, reduce risks 

-types of data :  routing monitors (bgp, ospf), active measurement (path toppology, performance), passive measurements (snmp counters, wireless metrixs)

- public source of data : bgp data (routeviews, ripe, ris), topology (caida ark, ripe atlas), access, path performance (m lab, fccc samknows), wireless data (crawdad)
-clse to core
	- looking glass servers : connected to major isp, ixp, allow interactive queries, bgp, ping traceroute
	- distributed servers : planet lab, m lab, deployed in university campus, data centers, well connected powerful machines, support uniing measurment scipts
- at the edge
	- low cost monitors : ripe atlas, sam knows bismark, deployed close users, more diverse connectivy constrained machines
	- software platform : dasu, fathom, easier to deploy, large number of users, not always on

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Bandwidth
-Metrics :
	- Capacity : Maximum transfer rate of maximum sized packets
	- Available bandwidth : available bandwidth at a given time interval
	- Buld transfer caapcity : througput of a single tcp connection depend on transfer size, tcp configuration, congestion on reverse path, cross traffic

- end to end measuremnt:
	-active : capacity =, available bandwith, bulk trasnfer caoacuty, measure any path with access to sorce and/or destination
	- passive : configured capacity, utilization, measure single links or small number of links
	
Active measurment:
	- controol of source and destination : source issue probe, destination received with timestamp and estime metrics from set of probes
	- control of source of path : issue probe and estimate metrics from repsonse, hard to distinging properties fo forward and reverse paths

Probing method of active measurement:
	- FLOODING : issue large number of probes to fill path, measure what users can get, but large overhead affect network and users for bulk transfer capacity, available bandwidth iperf3, speedtest
	- ADVANCED METHOD : less overhead than flooding, rely on assumptions that dont always hold in practive
		- packet pair 
			- END TO END CAPACITY : C = size packet / inter gap. send a pair of equal sized packets back to back and measure the inter packet gap at destination. prob size and interval, cross traffic will modify inter probe gap, gap hard to measure at high capacity
			- available bandwidth with packet pair: a = C * (1 - deltad - deltas / deltas). use pari of probes to measure capacity and cross traffic. bottle neck router queue not emptuy between probes, requires fifo queueing
		- size delay : 
			- Capacity : T(L) =  alpha + beta * L, first term propagation delay and second term trasmission delay, send rtt probes with varying packet sizess and estimate alpha an dbeta, the capcity is the inverse of beta but presend of cross traffic will break assumptions, and packet size may vary in the network
		-self induced congestion
			available bandwith: send train of equal size probes with rate R adn search R

Connectivity, latency, lsos, geolocate

Connectivity : 
	network : link down, confestion, routing loop, firewall or middle box
	host : is down, runnning, network interface down, service not available
Losses:
	best effort
	cause of loss: 
		congestion : full buffers, queue management
		medium errors: wireless, fiber optics, individual bits, data link retransmit
		routing loops ttl equal 0
	loss rate : wealthier counjtry 0.1% poorer country 1%
latency : rtt
	component: propagation, transmission, processing, queuing delay
	clock : offset, skew, drift
	tools : tcptrace, ping, owamp
	geolocation : intllectual proparty owners to control delivery, advertisers to target content, security prof to monitor, mulitlateration

Traffic measurement

Packet capture:
	on end system: capture packet passing trhough an interface usibg tcpdump libcap wireshark
	in broadcast lan : promiscuous mode
	point to point link : 
		port mirroring : copies packet from one or more ports to a mirroring port, run packet capturing tool on host connected to mirroring port. easy to setup and low cost but hardware and media errors are dropped, packets may be dropped at high use
		network tap : electrical or optical splitter on mo,nitored link, monitoring host with specialized network interface and interface driver. monitor all packets eliminate risk of dropped packets but expensive

Interface count: router log simple stat and we can request stats using snmp. it little performance impact on routers, is supported on al networking equipment, and little storage needs but there can be missing data becase dnmp use udp , polling makes it hard to synchronize data from multiple interface and there is coarse grained measuremnts

Flow capture: 
	step 1 capture ; specify set of properties that define a flow, the router log stats per flow, and then push flow record to collecting process ipfix.
	step 2 collect :
		- route cpu that generates flow records bu tit degrade forwarding experience
		- line card that generate flow recors it's more efficient to suport measurment in each  line card
		- packet monitor that generate flow record but it often require third party equipment
	flow cache : matinain a cache of active flows, compute a keu per incoming packet, index into the flow cached based on the key
	evicting cache entries:
		flow time out : remove flow that have not recevied a packet recentluy, periodic sequencing through the cache to time out flwos, new packet triggers the creation of a new flow
		cache replacement : remove flow when the flow cache is full, evict existing flow upon ceating a new cache entry, apply eviction policy
		long lived flow

flow monitoring give more detail about traffic compared tocounters, lower measurment volume than full packet traces, available on high end line card, control over overheaf via aggregation and sampling but it five less detail than packet capture, not uniformly supported and need computation memory for the flow cache

Interface counts is use everywhere : track link use and detect anomaly, generate bill for traffic on customer link, infer the offer load
packet monitoring is used in selcted location to anazlyse the small time scale behaviour of traffic and trouble shoot specific probelm on demand
flow monitor us used selective too ie network edge to track the application mix direct computation of the traffic matrix and inpu to ddos detection

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
Traffic matrix
	def :representation of traffic volume flowing from source to destination
	use : capacaity planning, traffic engineering, billing, peering analysisn anomaly detection, desing of new protocol
	origin destinaiton matrices : hard to work with, aggretion into block of ip addres, no single entity see the internet od matrix
	ingress router to egress router amtrix
	binning traffic : depedns on task , measurement tools, storage facilities available
	build a traffic matrix :
		packety capture : give the msot detaied view of traffic but exepensive and high collecito of overheafd
		flow cature;  enough to build traffic matrix and lower colleciton overheaf
		interface counts : cannot directly measure traffic matrix must estimate but lowers overheaf and widely avaibalbe

Application ientiifiacaiton mdethod:
	- port based : simplae, fast but used in firewalls and becoming more and more innacurate
	- content based : widely used ids and very accurate but privacy issue, compute intensive, encryption
	- behabior based : very richliterature but not very practival

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
Security

traffic anomaly detection
	data source : snmp, netflow, packet capture
	method : outlier beahviour with respect to some normal pattern
	suitable for volume attacks
	approach : temportal identify noraml traffic behaviour by analys=zing time series of each link, spaitail identify normal traffic behaviour across multiple elements of the traffic matrix
		
network intrusion detection systems
	data source : online packet analysis
	method: configured with acl and signatures
	to watch violation of protocol and usual connectionpattern, look for malicious command sequance
	it(s reactive not proactive, monitor performance at high speed link, encryption and skill hacker can evade
	
network telescope:
	monitor traffic tageting unused address space
	to detect dos, worm, scan vulnarable host

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=
Privacy

Privacy harm: identity thieft, decision based on personal data, blackmail, goven=rnament surveillance
anonymization : if data leak less risk, data sharing

Anonymization : 
	what : identity, personal organization, buisness info
	how :
		lossless transformation : two way hash function, mapping is not lost, can do dorrelation
		semi lossy transofrmation : remove portion of a string
		lossy transforamtion : one way hashing with secret salt
	properties of anonymized dataset :
		k anonymity : a quasi identifier appear in at least k record but if data not diverse in a class no privacy
		i diversity : enable to have diversity of data but diversity is difficul t to achieve
		t closeness : distriction of sensitive attribute close to original distribution

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
OSN
	def : online system centered on users
	clients :
		osn developrs : content popularity distribution, trust relations ships
		advertisers : target ads based on user profile, social influence in ads
		socioligisdt : social dunamics and infleunce
	how : osn graph, evolution of osn graph, content
	basic characteristic : number of user: firend count distribution, personal attirbute, sub communitites
	properties : intercommunicationf requesncy, popularity growth, rate of change of content	
	measurement method : direct access of databases or crawling using web interface

Cnesorship
	def : an entity that desires that some identifiable commmunication s blocked from being transmitted
	why : political stability, national security, social values
	how : 
		bloci ip addresses configur router using acl, its quick and easu to configure and routers ahave efficia=ent technique for ip matching, but it need to know the ip, collateral damage, use bgp to block ip bgp poisoning instrad of configuring router acl just advertise a bogus route a lot of collateral damage
		block hostname with dns  
		distrupt tcp flows, 
		http transfer

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Geolocation
	reasons : marketing, intellectual property rights, cybersecurity,
	how : 
		metadata lookup
		rtt measurements : landmarks and targets
		shortest ping : geolocate a host X according to ping from vantage point. host is at the vantage point if the ping from the vantage give the less rtt. it works well with short rtts.
		geoping : place a host X at a location Y or Z by comparing the vector distance from vantage points to said location and to host X
		CBG : overlapping disk, intersection of 2 disk
		multilateration : 3+ disks, to calcullate disk euclidean distance, haversine formula, distance on a sphere, distance on an ellipsoid vincenty formula
		TBG : disk + connection
		Street level : connection + closeness
